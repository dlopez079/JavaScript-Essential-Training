# JavaScript-Essential-Training

I created this respository to save some of my JavaScript Essential Training.  Throughout the repository, I will take some of the examples provided and practice the language.  For every change that I make to a problem, I will save to the respository. 

It is important to go back to the most simple problems and practice them over and over so that your mind can easily expand to more complex problems.  It is also important that you always remain sharp in your JavaScript skills.
